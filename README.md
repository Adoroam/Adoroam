## Howdy! I'm Anthony üõ†Ô∏è

*he/him* ASD/ADHD

I'm a software engineer with a love for efficiency, automation, and building tools.

**Current Hyperfixation:** Svelte

**What I'm up to?**

- Learning the latest bleeding edge tech
- Designing and creating tools to help myself and others
- Making my discord bot play meme sound effects
- Freelancing to help the little guys
- Doing my best to keep my documentation up-to-date
- Refactoring my old code to remind myself how bad I used to be

**What I'm looking for?**

I'm not trying to automate Janet in marketing out of a job, but I would like to spend a day making a webapp so she can click one button to pull in the client list, remove duplicate entries, compare the remaining entries against the clients in the database that opted-out of the newsletter, and then send that revised list to the newsletter api so she doesn't have to do it all by hand for like 3 hours every other Tuesday.

I like to spend some time in other's shoes to find ways to improve their efficiency and overall happiness. If the pandemic has taught us anything it's that people are happier when they have more time for their passions and their families. I'm hoping to find a place where I can put my broad but extensive knowlege to good use solving problems and saving time.
